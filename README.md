## README

The repository initially has two R scripts in .ipynb:

- `WIP_Test_1.ipynb`
- `WIP_Test_2cloud.ipynb`

The `WIP_Test_1.ipynb` is a small script that runs an example on local files derived from the Hubbard Brook 1m DEM. 
This notebook also saves the Random Forest Model as a .RData file that can be uploaded elsewhere.

`WIP_Test_2cloud.ipynb` is a draft of a script for WA state where a DEM and NWI wetland data are downloaded from the Planetary Computer stac.

This info is subject to change and is currently in development
